## Background

As of Summer 2020, a number of groups and prospective stakeholder types had been identified as groups impacted by this project. Some of them interact with TDRS directly, and some are impacted indirectly. The original TDRS personas that were identified can be found in the personas mural linked below.

We expect that there will be a couple hundred users who interact with the TDRS system, made up of both STT and OFA staff.

For the purposes of the OFA MVP, the only users who will have access to the application will be OFA Admin and STT (test) users.  Raft team or OFA will be acting as STT users for the OFA MVP.

## Grantee-level Stakeholders

### In-house data preppers 

STT data preppers are in-house STT staff who collect the TANF data and get it ready for submission. 

They may be the only person who works on reporting and have competing responsibilities like program management or administrative duties. Or, they could work on a team where there are multiple data preppers to help with reporting.

There are a number of factors that affect the experience of a STT data prepper (and may become sub personas with more research):

- If they're a tribal grantee
- If they submit sample or universal data
- If TANF is administered by counties or the state
- If they have an integrated eligibility system
- Their availability of staff and technical resources



### Third-party data preppers

We suspect that some STTs have access to systems or hire third party teams that manage their TANF data transmission for them. More research is needed in this area.



### Third-party analysts

In Round 3 research we encountered a data prepper working at an STT with a team structure made up of contract workers as well as government employees. The participant told us that these contract workers sat on the team in the role of Business Analysts. Brief secondary research indicates that Business Analysts exist at several other STTs as well working on or alongside TANF programs.



### Program directors

STT program directors manage data preppers and ensure that their STT is staffed and trained to meet federal reporting requirements. They are typically less involved with data collection details and formatting, but want to make sure their teams have the tools they need to get the job done.



### Technical staff

Some STTs segment data preparation and data transmission into two distinct roles. We've encountered references to (SFTP) transmission being handled by IT workers or by technical offices at the STT level who work with other STT agencies and departments, not just those dealing with TANF. 

We believe some

## OFA Stakeholders

### OFA analysts

OFA analysts review, analyze, and report on STT’s TANF data that’s submitted through TDRS. They also help STTs through the transmission process by offering support and guidance around data quality (including fatal/warning edits).

### OFA program directors (OFA admin)

OFA program directors oversee the collection and processing of TANF data and ensure OFA analysts have what they need to do their work.



### Regional program specialists

Regional program specialists are STTs primary OFA point of contact. They track TANF trends in their region and provide troubleshooting and advice to STTs.



### OPRE analysts

OPRE studies ACF programs and the populations they serve through rigorous research and evaluation projects. They use TANF data in their analyses. More research is needed in this area, especially on where overlaps exist with OFA analysts.



### OCIO staff

OCIO staff oversees tech projects within ACF. They provide technical and security support to ACF's tech products.
