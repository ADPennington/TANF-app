## Team Definition of Done

In order to define an issue as done, it needs to have passed a Raft Review and the [QASP Review](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/How-We-Work/Quality-Expectations.md) and follows [our branching strategy](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/How-We-Work/Branching-Strategy.md) which results in the code being available in the HHS/TANF-app repo.
