# Risk Assessment
## RA-05 - VULNERABILITY SCANNING

The organization:  
a. Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported;  

b. Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:  
   1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;  
   2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and  
   3. Measuring vulnerability impact;  

c. Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;  

d. Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and  

e. Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).  

### TDP Implementation

	a. Security scans are completed [weekly, daily, monthly] or when vulnerability reports from [NIH?] are received.
	b. Security scanning is completed using OWASP ZAP scans and Snyk dependency scanning.  Results from the scans are reviewed to determine the severity ratings and impact to the system.
	c. Scan reports from the OWASP ZAP and Snyk tools are reviewed to determine if any of the findings are false positives.  For the valid findings/vulnerabilities that are either High or Moderate, the team determines if there are any compensating controls to lower the severity rating.  
	d. Valid findings/vulnerabilities are remediated within the specified SLA as found in [is there a policy/procedures for vulnerability management?].  High risk findings are remediated within [SLA], Moderate are remediated within [SLA], and Low are remediated within [SLA].
	e. Information from the scan reports and control assessments are shared with the appropriate stakeholders [who are the stakeholders?].
