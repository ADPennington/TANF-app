### TDP Implementation

**Part a.**  
The TANF Data Portal (TDP) system has explicitly defined the roles and responsibilities that accounts perform to operate and maintain the system. This includes data creation and processing, software development, maintenance, and security implementation.

Every role has flags associated with the account.  These flags are *SuperUser* and *Staff* and are set to *False* by default.  When a new TDP account is created, the OFA Admin has the ability to set the flags to *True* based on the user's job responsibilities.  Note: if an account has the *Staff* flag set to *True*, the account will have access to Django Admin, but will not have access to any of the account management functionality.

The TDP system has two roles: OFA Admin and Data Prepper.
  * OFA Admin has the following abilities: security functionality to manage TDP accounts through Django Admin, upload data on behalf of Data Preppers, upload data files locally into the web application
  * OFA Admin *SuperUser* and *Staff* flags are both set to *True*.  This gives the OFA Admin the ability to access Django Admin and access to account management functionality.
  * Data Prepper roles are users from the states, tribes, and territories (STT) who will be uploading data.  Data Preppers collect TANF data, create data files, and transmit final data to OFA through the TANF application.  Data Preppers reads data over assigned region and are able to upload and submit new TANF reports, replace and resubmit TANF reports.
  * Data Prepper *SuperUser* and *Staff* flags are both set to *False*.  Data Preppers do not have access to Django Admin, cannot provision new TDP accounts, and do not have access to the account management functionality.

Developers of the TDP application are responsible for the software development and maintenance of the system.
  * Developers are granted only enough permission in GitHub and Cloud.gov to support their duties.    
  * All code and documentation committed to HHS has to be approved by the Product Manager and the HHS Tech Lead.

The Assistant Director of the TANF Data Division (System Owner) has the role of OFA Admin to be able to manage the account access to the TDP application. Additionally, System Owner provisions a new user account on request.


**Part b.**  

**Developers**  
Developers are granted only enough permission in GitHub and Cloud.gov in order to support their duties.  All code and documentation committed to HHS has to be approved by the Product Manager and the HHS Tech Lead.  

**Users (OFA Admin and Data Preppers)**
The OFA Admin approves new users, updates profile information, deactivates, and reactivates users (Data Preppers (STTs) do not have access to this).  Additionally, OFA admins have the ability to upload data on behalf of Data Preppers and upload data files locally into the web application. 

Users from the states, tribes, and territories (STT) who will be uploading data will have the role Data Preppers.  Data Preppers collect TANF data and transmit final data to OFA through the TANF application.  Data Preppers reads data over assigned region and are able to upload and submit new TANF reports, replace and resubmit TANF reports. 

**Part c.**   
To gain access to the TDP system, users must first create an account at Login.gov.  By creating an account in Login.gov, the user's profile is created within TDP and they have access to the TDP system without user functionality.  After they are authenticated with Login.gov, the user is redirected to the TDP frontend landing page.  Once a user is logged into the TDP system, they can request user functionality by submitting their information through the request form.  The OFA Admin can view the request through the Django Admin and grants the user the appropriate permissions based on their job responsibilities.  

***Access to the Django admin interface***  

Access directly to the Django interface requires the user have the and *staff* flag set.  To be able perform account management functions within Django Admin, the user must have both the *SuperUser* and *Staff* flags set and assigned permissions based on responsibilities.  

***Access to the TDP system***  

Users authenticate with Login.gov via the systemâ€™s backend service. The user is then redirected to the frontend landing page.
