# OWASP Zap Scan HTML Report

We have added a feature to the CI/CD which produces a report in HTML for the OWASP Zap scan. 
This will make it much easier to review the results of these scans. This document shows how
to access the report.

### Accessing the HTML Report

1. When a pull request is issue, the CI/CD checks automatically kick off. Go to the bottom of the
Conversation screen to see the checks running.
