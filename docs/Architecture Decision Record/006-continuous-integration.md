Date: 2021-08-04 (Updated 2021-12-20)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For improvement of our software engineering processes, we should implement continuous integration.


## Decision

We will use CircleCI as our continuous integration platform.

## Consequences

Using CircleCI for continuous integration and deployment  (CI/CD) will make the ATO process simpler. 

## Notes

CircleCI has a FedRAMP ATO on file. It is used to automate builds, testing, and deploys from GitHub.
