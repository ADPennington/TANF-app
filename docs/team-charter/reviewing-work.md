# Government Review 

Based on the September 2020 iron triangle conversations, the product team committed to the following: 

1. Prioritizing quality over time and scope. Quality is the rigid end of the triangle while time and scope are flexible ends of the triangle.  
2. Raft moves issues to QASP review pipeline if and only if Raft believes issues meet the AC. [who checks off the AC has not been determined – so far – until Sprint 4 - Lauren/QASP reviewers have been checking off the AC]. If AC cannot be met or has to be updated, then Rafter(s) document the change/update in GitHub.    
3. Issue(s) are submitted for QASP review on a rolling basis. For each sprint, Raft submits at least one issue for QASP review.
