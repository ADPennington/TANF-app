# Our Team Communication Tools  
 

## MS Teams Chat 

- Chat conversation should default to the most inclusive channel to which the topic is relevant so various team members may chime in and stay up-to-date. Direct 1:1 messaging between individuals is okay if you’re confident the conversation would not be helpful to others. 


## MS Teams Files 

- Text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations should be stored on OFA’s MS Teams Files. This includes user research interview notes and project planning documents. 
- Raw user research interview notes should have restricted access and only be available to the core research team. Participants should have code names and notes should be anonymized of PII after each session. Learn more about how we manage research records and protect participant privacy here. 


## Mural  

- OFA’s TANF Data Portal Project Mural Room  
- Currently, only Lauren has member access. Other should be able to edit Murals as visitors after entering the password. - 
- All links can be found on the wiki
