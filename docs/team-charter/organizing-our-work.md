Boards/Workspaces 

We have three project management boards for organizing our work: 

Sprint Board: This is only for the issues our team committed to for the current sprint. This lives in the Raft GitHub account. 
 

Product Backlog: This is where the PO can stage user stories, adjust prioritization, and prepare issues to bring to Sprint Planning meetings. This also lives in the Raft GitHub account. 
 

Project Backlog: This is for project and contract management tasks. It’s the domain of OFA and 18F and lives on 18F’s Trello account.
