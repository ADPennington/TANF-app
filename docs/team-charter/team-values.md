# Our Vision 
Our team will build a new, secure, web-based data reporting system to improve the federal reporting experience for TANF grantees and federal staff. The new system will allow grantees to easily submit accurate data and be confident that they have fulfilled their reporting requirements. This will reduce the burden on all users, improve data quality, inform better policy and programs, and ultimately help low-income families. 
 
# Our Values 

- We work together and ask for help. We don’t fall into a pit of silence trying to solve or finish something alone. Pairing is the norm.  
- We invite feedback and give it graciously. We ask for feedback early and often. We trust our team mates to tell us when we can do better and give us the chance to improve. We tell our them how we prefer to receive feedback and respect their preferences when we give feedback. 
- We reflect on our own process and behaviors. We acknowledge our mistakes and learn from them. It’s only “failure” if you fail to learn from it. We constantly look to refine and improve how we work together. 
- We assume best intent. We separate intention from impact. Use specific examples, and avoid generalizations. Forgive. 
- When we see something, we say something. Don’t be afraid to surface problems that you may become aware of, “ping” a teammate on stale ticket, or provide feedback. Acknowledge and discuss things that aren’t working well (without blame) with an eye towards improvements. Have a real chat about resolving something rather than perpetuating misunderstandings.  
- We default to openness and transparency. We ask questions in the open, general channels whenever possible.  
- We state our goals explicitly and re-check them periodically. At the beginning of meetings, we state our goals and check if there’s any reason for adjusting that goal.  At the end of meetings, we make sure to summarize commitments.  


# Our Individual Preferences 

While we share values, we also have our individual preferences, habits, and peeves. Take some time to read our team forming Mural and understand how our team mates like to work, what makes them grumpy, and how they prefer feedback as
